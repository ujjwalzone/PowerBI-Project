# PowerBI-Project
Student Performance Dashboard
Project Overview
This project features a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze, track, and visualize student performance data. It provides in-depth insights into student grades, enrollment trends, subject distribution, and payment methods. The goal of this dashboard is to help educators, administrators, and decision-makers identify trends, optimize educational strategies, and improve student outcomes based on data-driven insights.

With interactive visualizations, users can explore various dimensions of student performance, including academic achievements, enrollment patterns, financial transactions, and subject-wise distribution across different countries. The dashboard is structured into two levels—Basic Level and Intermediate Level, each offering unique insights and advanced analytics.
